                Newvasha Development EPZ Limited is an Export Processing Zone
                (EPZ) located in Naivasha, Kenya. As an EPZ, we work to develop
                and promote industrial and economic activities within this
                designated geographic area. To carry out our commitment, we
                partner with dynamic businesses that focus on export-oriented
                production.
              </p>
              <p>
                The creation of Newvasha started with recognizing a need. A
                company approached our ownership as they were searching for a
                location to produce export products. Other EPZs in Kenya were
                not viable options, as many are located in dis organized,
                chaotic urban areas with a lack of physical space and strict
                requirements for export production.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a privately owned EPZ strategically located in a spacious and
                affordable area, Newvasha addresses these challenges. We offer
                the flexibility to purchase a plot, lease space, or build to a
                business specifications with plenty of support and opportunities
                for growth.
